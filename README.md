Prabhav Pranay Nerurkar (College - Mulund College of Commerce)

I am a dedicated and collaborative team member with a strong commitment to research and technical excellence.For my final project, I worked in a team with Nikhil Damse and Omkar Bhambid. In that project, I played a important role by writing the comprehensive research paper, ensuring it met academic standards and effectively communicated our findings. Additionally, I independently completed the first lab (TryHackMe) assignment, showcasing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. I also took the initiative to complete the second assignment, the Leviathan Lab, further demonstrating my technical proficiency and problem-solving skills. The remaining two labs(Krypton,Natas) were successfully executed by my teammates, reflecting our collective effort and coordination. This experience has enhanced my skills in research, technical implementation, and teamwork.
